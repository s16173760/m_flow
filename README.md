## What is M-flow?

M-flow is not a vector database or a RAG framework. It is a **cognitive memory engine** — a system that doesn't just store text, but *understands* it, distilling incoming knowledge into structured layers and weaving them into the right place of a persistent architecture.

Where traditional retrieval matches queries by surface similarity, M-flow **reasons through relationships** — tracing connections, weighing context, and reaching answers the way cognition does.

Most AI memory systems fall into two categories:

- **Context Window** — The model re-reads everything from scratch. Exhaustive, linear, forgetful.
- **Similarity Search** — External memory exists, but retrieval is surface-level — matching by vector shape, blind to structure. Approximate, lossy.

M-flow introduces a third paradigm: a **Cognitive Engine** where memory becomes a mind. A query at any granularity finds a precise anchor, then expands outward — surfacing related context and associative content across different levels of detail.

## How It Works

M-flow organizes knowledge into a four-level **Cone Graph** — a layered hierarchy from abstract summaries to atomic facts:

| Level | What it captures | Query example |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Episode** | A bounded semantic focus — an incident, decision process, or workflow | *"What happened with the tech stack decision?"* |
| **Facet** | One dimension of that Episode — a topical cross-section | *"What were the performance targets?"* |
| **FacetPoint** | An atomic assertion or fact derived from a Facet | *"Was the P99 target under 500ms?"* |
| **Entity** | A named thing — person, tool, metric — linked across all Episodes | *"Tell me about GPT-4o"* → surfaces all related contexts |

Retrieval is **graph-routed**: the system casts a wide net across all levels, projects hits into the knowledge graph, propagates cost along every possible path, and scores each Episode by its **tightest chain of evidence**. One strong path is enough — the way a single association triggers an entire memory.

## Features

| | |
|---------|-------------|
| **Episodic + Procedural memory** | Hierarchical recall for facts and step-by-step knowledge |
| **5 retrieval modes** | Episodic, Procedural, Triplet Completion, Lexical, Cypher |
| **50+ file formats** | PDFs, DOCX, HTML, Markdown, images, audio, and more |
| **Multi-DB support** | LanceDB, Neo4j, PostgreSQL/pgvector, ChromaDB, KùzuDB, Pinecone |
| **LLM-agnostic** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq, Ollama, LLaMA-Index, LangChain |
| **Precise summarization** | Preserves all factual details (dates, numbers, names) at the cost of lower compression — RAG context will be longer but more accurate |
| **MCP server** | Expose memory as Model Context Protocol tools for any IDE |
| **CLI & Web UI** | Interactive console, knowledge graph visualization, config wizard |

> **Retrieval modes**: **Episodic** is the primary retrieval mode — it uses graph-routed Bundle Search for best accuracy and is used in all benchmarks. **Triplet Completion** is a simpler vector-based mode suited for customization and secondary development. See [Retrieval Architecture](docs/RETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlowElement-ai/m_flow.git && cd m_flow
./quickstart.sh
```

The script checks your environment, configures API keys interactively, and starts the full stack (backend + frontend). On Windows, use `.\quickstart.ps1`.

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install mflow-ai         # or: uv pip install mflow-ai
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlowElement-ai/m_flow.git && cd m_flow
pip install -e .             # editable install for development
```

### Run

```python
import asyncio
import m_flow


async def main():
    await m_flow.add("M-flow builds persistent memory for AI agents.")
    await m_flow.memorize()

    results = await m_flow.search("How does M-flow work?")
    for r in results:
        print(r)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### CLI

```bash
mflow add "M-flow builds persistent memory for AI agents."
mflow memorize
mflow search "How does M-flow work?"
mflow -ui          # Launch the local web console
```
